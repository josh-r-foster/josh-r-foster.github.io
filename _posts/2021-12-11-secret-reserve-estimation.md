This letter proposes an estimation method for the distribution of unobservable secret seller reserve prices in auctions.  Within the symmetric independent private values model, I construct a two stage estimate via the semi-nonparametric quasi maximum likelihood density estimator developed by Gallant and Nychka (1987).  I then use Monte Carlo experiments to demonstrate its performance in relatively small samples.  A discussion on applying this method to structurally similar identification problems is provided.
