<h2>&#91;manuscript&#93; Auctions for Risk Averse Charities
</h2>

&#91;20 minute presentation&#93; <em>[June 2022](https://josh-r-foster.github.io/courses/research/risk-averse-charities/20-min.html)</em>

We report on the results of a lab experiment designed to provide a comprehensive evaluation of charity auction formats.  Ten distinct mechanisms are considered under conditions that allow for endogenous bidder participation and risk-averse charities.  We extend the traditional focus on mean revenue to its variance, and estimate a mean-variance tradeoff across mechanisms while exploring its practical implications for charities.  Last, we provide a theoretical framework against which our empirical results can be measured.
