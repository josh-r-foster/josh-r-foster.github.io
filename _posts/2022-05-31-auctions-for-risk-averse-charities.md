We report on the results of a lab experiment designed to provide a comprehensive evaluation of charity auction formats.  Ten distinct mechanisms are considered under conditions that allow for endogenous bidder participation and risk-averse charities.  We extend the traditional focus on mean revenue to its variance, and estimate a mean-variance tradeoff across mechanisms while exploring its practical implications for charities.  Last, we provide a theoretical framework against which our empirical results can be measured.
