				<h2>The Student's Predicament</h2>
				Hyperbolic discounting leads to procrastination. <br>

				Example: Doing problem sets...<br>

				<tr><td>    Time Step </td><td> Commitment Date </td></tr>
				<tr><td>     </td> </tr>

				<h2>Naivete Vs. Sophistication</h2>
				Extreme assumptions of behavior over time:
				<h2>Naivete:</h2>
				An individual who does not realize they will change their mind. That is, they assume their future self will follow through on their (current) preferred plan.



				<h2>Sophistication:</h2>
				An individual who understands perfectly that they will change their mind, and does the best given future self's anticipated behavior.

				</section>

				<section>
				<h2>Naivete Vs. Sophistication</h2>
				How could we tell whether a student is naive or sophisticated?
				<ul>
				<li class ="fragment fade-in-then-semi-out"> The use of commitment devices indicates sophistication</li>
				<ul>
				<li class ="fragment fade-in-then-semi-out"> Ulysses is (at least partly) sophisticated.</li>
				</ul>
				<li class ="fragment fade-in-then-semi-out"> Misprediction of future behavior indicates naivete.</li>
				<ul>
				<li class ="fragment fade-in-then-semi-out"> Teenage smokers who predict that they will not be smoking in five years have a slightly higher probability of smoking (74%) than those who predict they will be smoking (72%).</li>
				</ul>
				</ul>

				(BTW, awareness issues don't arise with exponential discounting.)

				This sophisticate wishes they were naive!
				</section>

				<section>
				<h2>The General Lesson</h2>
				The sophisticated movie-goer's problem is their pessimism.
				<ul>
				<li class ="fragment fade-in-then-semi-out"> Knows they won't have the patience to wait.</li>
				<li class ="fragment fade-in-then-semi-out"> So they go immediately.</li>
				</ul>


				This pessimism also leads them to do better with problem sets. <br>


				Principle:
				<ul>
				<li class ="fragment fade-in-then-semi-out"> Knowing their future selves will do it tomorrow makes sophisticates more impatient today.</li>
				<li class ="fragment fade-in-then-semi-out"> Additionally, knowing their future selves will cost them tomorrow warrants taking action today.</li>
				</ul>
				</section>

				<section>
				<h2>So Is It Really Worse to be Sophisticated?} </h2>
				Theoretically speaking, it's unclear. <br>


				Raises a number of concerns:
				<ul>
				<li class ="fragment fade-in-then-semi-out"> Finishing reports/papers/presentations.</li>
				<li class ="fragment fade-in-then-semi-out"> Finding good investments for retirement.</li>
				<li class ="fragment fade-in-then-semi-out"> Quitting bad habits.</li>
				<li class ="fragment fade-in-then-semi-out"> Finding a job (e.g. for unemployed).</li>
				</ul>

				<section>
				<h2>Default Effects <br></h2>
				 Madrian and Shea (2001) \emph{Quarterly Journal of Economics}}
				401(k) Participation
				<ul>
				<li class ="fragment fade-in-then-semi-out"> 401(k)s are offered by many employers</li>
				<ul>
				<li class ="fragment fade-in-then-semi-out"> Primary way employees privately save for retirement.</li>
				</ul>
				<li class ="fragment fade-in-then-semi-out"> Employees decide themselves whether to participate:</li>
				<ul>
				<li class ="fragment fade-in-then-semi-out"> How much of their pay to allocate to the 401(k), and</li>
				<li class ="fragment fade-in-then-semi-out"> How to invest their funds.</li>
				</ul>
				<li class ="fragment fade-in-then-semi-out"> This company offered a match (up to 6% of income):</li>
				<ul>
				<li class ="fragment fade-in-then-semi-out"> For every $1 an employee put in their 401(k)</li>
				<li class ="fragment fade-in-then-semi-out"> The company added 50 cents.</li>
				</ul>
				</ul>
				</section>

				<section>
				On April 1, 1998, the company changed their 401(k) policy:
				<ol>
				<li class ="fragment fade-in-then-semi-out"> Before: could only participate after one year of employment. <br></li>
				After: all employees could enroll.
				<li class ="fragment fade-in-then-semi-out"> Before: employees were not automatically enrolled.</li>
				<ul>
				<li class ="fragment fade-in-then-semi-out"> (Could enroll easily at any time.)</li>
				</ul>
				After: employees were automatically enrolled.
				<ul>
				<li class ="fragment fade-in-then-semi-out"> (Could unenroll easily at any time.)</li>
				</ul>
				</ol> 
				The authors compare the choices of two groups of employees:
				<ol>
				<li class ="fragment fade-in-then-semi-out"> "Window" cohort: those hired in 1998 before April 1</li>
				<ul>
				<li class ="fragment fade-in-then-semi-out"> (Not automatically enrolled.)</li>
				</ul>
				<li class ="fragment fade-in-then-semi-out"> "New" cohort: those hired in 1998 after April 1</li>
				<ul>
				<li class ="fragment fade-in-then-semi-out"> (Automatically enrolled.)</li>
				</ul>
				</ol>
				</section>

				<section>
				<h2>Results: Participation and Contribution Rates</h2>
				3-15 months after being hired, participation rates were:
				<ul>
				<li class ="fragment fade-in-then-semi-out"> 37% for the Window cohort</li>
				<li class ="fragment fade-in-then-semi-out"> 86% for the New cohort</li>
				 </ul> 
				The contribution rates were as follows:
				 <p align="center">
				<img src="/images/teaching/participation.png">
				</p> 
				The finding that defaults matter is one of the most important discoveries in applied microeconomics.
				</section>

				<section>
				<h2>Getting a Grip on the Default Effect</h2>
				This appears to be a big mistake by not participating in the 401(k)
				<ul>
				<li class ="fragment fade-in-then-semi-out"> Being offered a 50% return on up to 6% of your income.</li>
				</ul> 
				Example: for an employee making $40,000
				<ul>
				<li class ="fragment fade-in-then-semi-out"> That's giving up a $1,200 gift from the company.</li>
				</ul> 
				Even if it is not a mistake, why does the default matter so much?
				<ul>
				<li class ="fragment fade-in-then-semi-out"> It only takes a phone call to change enrollment.</li>
				</ul> 
				Would people not bother making a phone call for $1,200? <br>
				<ul>
				<li class ="fragment fade-in-then-semi-out"> If they are naive hyperbolic discounters, they might not.</li>
				<li class ="fragment fade-in-then-semi-out"> And as a result, defaults can be extremely important.</li>
				</ul>
				</section>

				<section>
				<h2>Making the Call: "I'll do it tomorrow"</h2>
				Costs and Benefits of Making the Call: <br>
				<ul>
				<li class ="fragment fade-in-then-semi-out"> Benefit: will get $5 per day ($1,825 per year) extra for the next 30 years starting tomorrow.</li>
				<li class ="fragment fade-in-then-semi-out"> Cost: pain of the phone call today costs $30</li>
				</ul> 
				Assume a naive hyperbolic discounter has a daily $\beta = 0.8$, $\delta = 1$. <br>


				When to make the call:
				<ul>
				<li class ="fragment fade-in-then-semi-out"> Today: $-30+0.8\cdot[5\cdot 365\cdot 30] = 43770$ </li>
				<li class ="fragment fade-in-then-semi-out"> Tomorrow: $0+0.8\cdot[-30+5\cdot 365\cdot 30 - 5] = 43772$</li>
				</ul> 
				Hence, they put off making the phone call. 
				<ul>
				<li class ="fragment fade-in-then-semi-out"> If nothing changes, they put off the phone call forever.</li>
				</ul>
				</section>

				<section>
				<h2>Making the Call: "I'll do it this week (Really, I will)"</h2>
				This prediction is extreme - and it's because the model is extreme. 
				<ul>
				<li class ="fragment fade-in-then-semi-out"> More reasonable prediction might be they delay for a long time.</li>
				</ul>


				Let's change the model:
				<ul>
				<li class ="fragment fade-in-then-semi-out"> What would a sophisticate do? </li>
				<li class ="fragment fade-in-then-semi-out"> It's easy to argue they'd do it within a week. </li>
				<ul>
				<li class ="fragment fade-in-then-semi-out"> Waiting 8 days costs $40, valued at $0.8\cdot 40=32$</li>
				<li class ="fragment fade-in-then-semi-out"> Would rather pay the $30 cost today to avoid this outcome.</li>
				</ul>
				</ul>


				When \emph{exactly} they make the call is a more difficult question.
				</section>

				<h2>Other Studies on Procrastination</h2>
				Choi, et al. (2004) in \emph{NBER}
				<ul>
				<li class ="fragment fade-in-then-semi-out"> 401(k) contribution patterns generalize.</li>
				<li class ="fragment fade-in-then-semi-out"> Remarkably similar results across three different industries.</li>
				</ul>


				Cronqvist and Thaler (2004) in \emph{American Economic Review}
				<ul>
				<li class ="fragment fade-in-then-semi-out"> Looks at the privatization of retirement funds in Sweden.</li>
				<li class ="fragment fade-in-then-semi-out"> Heavily advertised by the government - 456 plans available. </li>
				<li class ="fragment fade-in-then-semi-out"> Initially, 43.3% of participants chose the default. </li>
				<li class ="fragment fade-in-then-semi-out"> After 3 years, 91.6% of participants chose the default plan.</li>
				</ul>


				Traditional economics: this is due to transaction costs.
				<ul>
				<li class ="fragment fade-in-then-semi-out"> But actual transaction costs are too small to explain this.</li>
				</ul>

				<section>
				<h2>Other Studies on Procrastination (Cont.)</h2>
				O'Donoghue and Rabin (1999, 2001) in \emph{AER} and \emph{QJE}
				<ul>
				<li class ="fragment fade-in-then-semi-out"> Self-control problems can explain this behavior.</li>
				<li class ="fragment fade-in-then-semi-out"> Naivete can create infinite procrastination. </li>
				<li class ="fragment fade-in-then-semi-out"> Increasing importance makes it more likely you procrastinate.</li>
				</ul>
				DellaVigna and Malmendier (2006) in \emph{AER}
				<ul>
				<li class ="fragment fade-in-then-semi-out"> Study gym-goers' behavior at three US health clubs. </li>
				<li class ="fragment fade-in-then-semi-out"> Customers had two options for how to pay for using the gym:</li>
				<ol>
				<li class ="fragment fade-in-then-semi-out"> Monthly fee of over $80 for unlimited use of the gym.</li>
				<li class ="fragment fade-in-then-semi-out"> Pay-per-visit fee of $10.</li>
				</ol> 
				<li class ="fragment fade-in-then-semi-out"> Most choose the monthly contract (89%)</li>
				<ul>
				<li class ="fragment fade-in-then-semi-out"> Those who do exercise on average 4.8 times/month </li>
				<li class ="fragment fade-in-then-semi-out"> That's about $17 per visit.</li>
				</ul> 
				<li class ="fragment fade-in-then-semi-out"> \emph{Default Effect:} go 2.31 months (average) without using membership before canceling.</li>
				</ul>
				</section>

				<section>
				It can be argued these findings are consistent with both extreme assumptions of hyperbolic discounting. <br>


				\underline{Naive hyperbolic discounters:} 
				<ul>
				<li class ="fragment fade-in-then-semi-out"> Gym-goers prefer they exercise a lot in the future. </li>
				<li class ="fragment fade-in-then-semi-out"> Being naive, that's what they think they'll do. </li>
				<li class ="fragment fade-in-then-semi-out"> To save money on gym they buy the monthly membership. </li>
				<li class ="fragment fade-in-then-semi-out"> Short-run impatience kicks in, and they don't use the membership much.</li>
				</ul>


				\underline{Sophisticated hyperbolic discounters:} 
				<ul>
				<li class ="fragment fade-in-then-semi-out"> Also prefer to exercise a lot in the future, but realize they won't. </li>
				<li class ="fragment fade-in-then-semi-out"> Use the monthly membership as a commitment tool. </li>
				<li class ="fragment fade-in-then-semi-out"> Willing to pay more (per-visit) if it helps get them to the gym.</li>
				</ul>

				<h2>Credit Card Teaser Rates</h2>
				Ausubel (1991) in \emph{American Economic Review}
				<ul>
				<li class ="fragment fade-in-then-semi-out"> Large-scale field experiment run by a credit card company. </li>
				<li class ="fragment fade-in-then-semi-out"> Mailed randomized credit card offers of three types:</li>
				<ol>
				<li class ="fragment fade-in-then-semi-out"> Standard: 6.9% rate for six months and 16% thereafter.</li>
				<li class ="fragment fade-in-then-semi-out"> Teaser deal: 4.9% followed by 16%.</li>
				<li class ="fragment fade-in-then-semi-out"> Post-teaser deal: 6.9% followed by 14%.</li>
				</ol> 
				<li class ="fragment fade-in-then-semi-out"> Data on take-up rates and 21 months of borrowing history. </li>
				<li class ="fragment fade-in-then-semi-out"> Results:</li>
				<ul>
				<li class ="fragment fade-in-then-semi-out"> Teaser is 2.5 more successful than Post-teaser</li>
				<li class ="fragment fade-in-then-semi-out"> Given borrowing history, Post-teaser is a much better deal.</li>
				</ul>
				</ul>
				</section>

				<section>
				<h2>Credit Card Teaser Rates - Explanations</h2>
				Possible explanations based on hyperbolic discounting: 
				<ol>
				<li class ="fragment fade-in-then-semi-out"> Naive borrowers believe they'll repay the loan quickly.</li>
				<ul>
				<li class ="fragment fade-in-then-semi-out"> Hence think the teaser interest rate is the most important.</li>
				</ul> 
				<li class ="fragment fade-in-then-semi-out"> Sophisticated borrowers don't want to use their credit cards much in the future.</li>
				<ul>
				<li class ="fragment fade-in-then-semi-out"> Hence choose a high interest rate to restrain future borrowing.</li>
