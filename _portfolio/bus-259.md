<p>This course uses behavioral economics to survey a range of social problems that directly impact community life.	 Behavioral economics is the study of how systematic errors in judgment impact economic outcomes. We will ask questions about how these errors influence decision making in business, consumer behavior, government, philanthropy, the environment, and our personal lives. Each week will be dedicated to a specific question for which behavioral economics can prescribe a method of civic engagement to build better communities.</p>

<p>Our discussions will prepare you with the civic knowledge and perspective to thoughtfully address challenges that your own community may face. Knowing how people respond to changes in various economic environments is of paramount importance when designing public policy. Those who are in a position to shape these economic environments are called <em>choice architects</em>. You will be encouraged to consider how you can ethically engage your community as a choice architect to improve social outcomes.</p>
