<p>
	This is an advanced course on the strategic behavior of firms and market design. Our primary consideration will be with respect to understanding how firms compete, and we will use the latest advances in microeconomic theory in this effort. Lectures will proceed as though you are versed in the microeconomic series (i.e. still familiar with ECON 206, 329), however we will begin with some refreshers of core concepts. A tool often used when studying industrial organization is game theory, which we will take time to learn what we need as we go. Though a firm’s pursuit of profit maximization will dominate our discussion, special consideration will be given to the “human side” of firms and how behavioral factors can inform public policy initiatives.
