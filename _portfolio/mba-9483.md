<p>The objective of this course is to introduce students to the foundations of managerial economics.  Its focus is on teaching you how to insert economic thinking at each decision node within an organization. I have recently updated this course to explore a variety of contemporary, real-world business topics, each of which will ground the your business acumen with the underlying economic framework that strong managers rely on to lead their organizations.  You will develop the hard skills you’ll use for economic modeling, understanding market incentives, and making strategic, objective-oriented decisions.  I believe you’ll come to find that while some market incentives are intuitive, others are less obvious and can have surprising interactions.</p> 

<p>This course is intended for a broad set of future business leaders, and it contains information that every manager will need to know.  This course is dedicated to those students who want to recognize the economic laws that govern their organization and their industry.  It is dedicated to those who want the ability to predict how connected markets dynamically evolve so that they may optimally position their organization for the future.  And it is dedicated to those who want to play a role in the market design of their industry and the means by which is serves their community.</p>

<p>If you’re going to take an economics-intensive elective during your MBA, you should take this course.  I believe you will find the insights it provides to be extremely valuable in defining your understanding of your organization’s position throughout the markets it competes in.</p>
