					<h2>What is Behavioral Economics?</h2>
					<p align="left" class="fragment fade-in-then-semi-out">A study of the joint influence of psychological and economic factors on behavior.</p> 
					<p align="left" class="fragment fade-in-then-semi-out">Behavioral economics is a modification of mainstream economics.</p> 
					<p align="left" class="fragment fade-in-then-semi-out"> Mainstream economics is called <span style="color:#ffcc00;">Neoclassical economics</span>.</p>
				</section>

				<section>
					<p align="left">Like neoclassical economics, behavioral:</p>
					<ul>
						<li class="fragment fade-in-then-semi-out"> Uses mathematical models to predict choices. </li>
						<li class="fragment fade-in-then-semi-out"> Assumes that individuals have goals (which provide <span style="color:#ffcc00;">utility</span>). </li>
						<li class="fragment fade-in-then-semi-out"> Explores how individual behavior varies across economic environments. </li>
						<li class="fragment fade-in-then-semi-out"> Is concerned with welfare consequences.</li>
					</ul>
				</section>

				<section>
					<p align="left">How is behavioral economics different from Neoclassical economics?</p>
					<p align="left" class ="fragment fade-in">Unlike neoclassical economics, behavioral:</p>
					<ul>
						<li class="fragment fade-in-then-semi-out"> Cares a lot about what <em>actually</em> motivates people. </li>
						<li class="fragment fade-in-then-semi-out"> Relies on experiments, surveys, psychology and neurology. </li>
						<li class="fragment fade-in-then-semi-out"> Emphasizes preferences, beliefs and cognition together.</li>
					</ul>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>Traditional Economic Assumptions</h2>
					<p align="left" class="fragment fade-in">We will critically examine the following assumptions:</p>
					<ul>
						<li class="fragment fade-in-then-semi-out"> People are purely self-interested.</li>
						<li class="fragment fade-in-then-semi-out"> People perfectly understand the laws of probability.</li>
						<li class="fragment fade-in-then-semi-out"> People have correct beliefs about all information.</li>
						<li class="fragment fade-in-then-semi-out"> People have preferences over final outcomes.</li>
						<li class="fragment fade-in-then-semi-out"> People have well-defined and stable preferences.</li>
						<li class="fragment fade-in-then-semi-out"> People discount tradeoffs over time optimally.</li>
					</ul>
					<p align="left" class ="fragment fade-in">These assumptions describe how people <em>should</em> behave.</p>
				</section>

				<section><h1>The Survey</h1></section>

				<section>
					<h2>The Survey</h2>
					<p align="left">For your homework you will fill out a survey asking:</p>
					<ul>
						<li class="fragment fade-in-then-semi-out">A few things about you.</li>
						<li class="fragment fade-in-then-semi-out">Your impressions of the world.</li>
						<li class="fragment fade-in-then-semi-out">How you would behave in certain situations.</li>
					</ul>
				</section>

				<section>
					<p align="left">There are actually <em>two versions</em> of the survey.</p>
					<ul>
						<li class="fragment fade-in-then-semi-out">The two versions contained slightly different questions.</li>
						<li class="fragment fade-in-then-semi-out">The two surveys were randomly assigned, so that it was random which version each of you received.</li>
					</ul>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>The Survey</h2>
					<p align="left">Economics experiments always contain two features.</p>
					<div class="fragment fade-in-then-semi-out">
						<h3>Randomization:</h3>
						<p align="left">Random assignment of subjects ensures that there are no inherent differences between the groups answering the different questions. The differences in behavior can be attributed solely to the different questions.</p>
					</div>
					<div class="fragment fade-in-then-semi-out">
						<h3>Experimental Manipulation:</h3>
						<p align="left">To learn what difference something makes in people's behavior, we vary that one thing between subjects.</p>
					</div>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>The Survey</h2>
					<p align="left">Ideally, we would observe people in their natural environments.</p>
					<ul>
						<li class="fragment fade-in-then-semi-out">Occasionally this is possible.</li>
						<li class="fragment fade-in-then-semi-out">However, the real world can be messy to study.</li>
						<li class="fragment fade-in-then-semi-out">We cannot always randomize or manipulate situations.</li>
						<li class="fragment fade-in-then-semi-out">In these cases, we run controlled experiments.</li>
					</ul>
				</section>

				<section>
					<p align="left">As a first look at experimentation, today let's</p>
					<ol>
						<li class="fragment fade-in-then-semi-out">Motivate individual behavior theoretically.</li>
						<li class="fragment fade-in-then-semi-out">Look at a natural experiment.</li>
						<li class="fragment fade-in-then-semi-out">Consider our surveys from the homework.</li>
					</ol>
				</section>

				<section><h1>Modeling Humans</h1></section>

				<section>
					<p align="left">Economists break down individual behavior into:</p>
					<ol>
						<li class="fragment fade-in"><span style="color:#ffcc00;">Utility</span>: What makes people happy in the moment.</li>
						<div class="fragment fade-in">
							<ul>
								<li>How people react towards risk.</li>
								<li>How people value the future.</li>
							</ul>

					<h2>Losses and Risk-taking</h2>

					<ul>
						<li class="fragment fade-in-then-semi-out">Many races on any given day.</li>
						<li class="fragment fade-in-then-semi-out">Payouts in each race are balanced by the bets made.</li>

					<h2>Losses and Risk-taking</h2>
					<div align="left" class="fragment fade-in-then-semi-out">
						<p align="left">Possible explanation: bettors take risks to "get even".</p>
						<ul>
							<li>That is, to finish the day without losses.</li>

					<p align="left" class="fragment fade-in">It is possible that:</p>
					<ul>
					<li class ="fragment fade-in"> Toward the end of the day, most bettors have lost money. </li>
					<li class ="fragment fade-in"> The only reasonable way to get back even is to spend a little more and make a bet with a potentially high payoff.</li>

					An actual quote from a horse betting strategy website:
					<blockquote style="font-size:33px;">
						"The best way to play a show parlay is to set a reasonable goal of how much you want to win and to keep betting the show parlay until you get there. You then start over. If you don't make it to your goal on the first try, you have only lost $10.<br><br>

						"Show parlays are affordable, fun and can be lucrative. They give you action on every race at a very low cost and the closer you get to your monetary goal, the more the tension and excitement builds." - predictem.com

					<h2>Strange Super Bowl Bets</h2>
					<p align="left">There are many odd bets bookies will take:</p>
					<ul>
						<li class="fragment fade-in-then-semi-out">Someone will streak on the field (4:1).</li>
						<li class="fragment fade-in-then-semi-out">Someone catches fire during the halftime show (25:1).</li>

					<h2>Internal Conflicts</h2>
					<p align="left">Two possible explanations:</p>
					<ol>
						<li class="fragment fade-in-then-semi-out">Bettors think they can lose weight, try to make money.</li>
						<li class="fragment fade-in-then-semi-out">They make the bet to incentivize them to lose weight.</li>

					<h2>Mistakes in Objective Probability Judgments</h2>
					<p align="left">Survey question:</p>
					<blockquote style="font-size:33px;">
					Suppose $\frac{1}{100}$ people have COVID-19.  We have a test for the virus that is 99% accurate.  This means that if a person has COVID-19, the test returns a positive result with 99% probability, and if a person does not have COVID-19, it returns a negative result with 99% probability.  If a person's test comes back positive, what is the probability that she has COVID-19?
					</blockquote>
				</section>

				<section>
					<p align="left">The majority of students (90%+) answered 99%. <span class="fragment fade-in">Possible logic:</span></p>
					<ul>
					<li class="fragment fade-in-then-semi-out">Positive person will probably receive a positive result (99% chance).</li>
					<li class="fragment fade-in-then-semi-out">  So if they tested positive, she is likely to have COVID-19 (also 99% chance).</li>
					</ul>
				</section>

				<section>
					<p align="left">Correct answer: 50% ($\sim$1% answers correctly)</p>
					<p align="left" class="fragment fade-in">Mistake made:</p>
					<ul>
						<li class="fragment fade-in-then-semi-out">Ignoring the base rate of COVID-19 in the population.</li>
						<li class="fragment fade-in-then-semi-out">Very few people have COVID-19.</li>
