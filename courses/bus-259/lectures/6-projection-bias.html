					<div class="fragment current-visible">
							<blockquote>
							"Heavier-than-air flying machines are impossible." <br> 
							- Baron Kelvin
							</blockquote> 
					</div>
					<div class="fragment current-visible">
						<blockquote>
						"Man will not fly for fifty years." <br> 
						- Wilbur Wright (1901)
						</blockquote> 
					</div>
					<div class="fragment current-visible">

						"Everything that can be invented has been invented." <br>

					<p align="left" class="fragment fade-up">People have a tough time imagining a future different from today.</p>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>Why are people wrong this way?</h2>
					<p align="left">Our imaginations are imperfect models of reality.</p>
					  
					<p align="left" class="fragment fade-in">If we imagine what something/someone could be like:</p>
					<ul>
						<li class ="fragment fade-in"> We typically see a sketchy image of it in our heads. </li>
						<li class ="fragment fade-in"> Our brain is activated in similar ways as when we are actually looking at it/them. </li>
					</ul>
				</section>

				<section>
					<p align="left">Imagining the future is a similar process.  Example:</p>
					<ul>
						<li class ="fragment fade-in"> "How would you feel if you found 100 bucks?" </li>
						<ul>
							<li class ="fragment fade-in"> I bet you visually imagined what would happen</li>
							<li class ="fragment fade-in"> And that image shaped your response.</li>
						</ul> 
					</ul>
					<p align="left" class ="fragment fade-in">Our ability to do this is limited, and affected by our current state.</p>
					<ul>
						<li class ="fragment fade-in"> When disgusted, it's hard to imagine affection.  </li>
						<li class ="fragment fade-in"> When satiated, it's hard to imagine hunger.</li>
					</ul>
				</section>

				<section><h1>What is Projection Bias?</h1></section>

				<section>
					<h2>Preferences Can Fluctuate Over Time</h2>
					<p align="left">There are many ways preferences change over time.  Examples:</p>
					<ol>
						<li class ="fragment fade-in"> Physical: hunger, addiction, aging, etc. </li>
						<li class ="fragment fade-in"> Experience: adventure, etc. </li>
						<li class ="fragment fade-in"> Environment: friends, weather, etc. </li>
					</ol>
				</section>

				<section>
					<p align="left">When making decisions today:</p>
					<ul>
						<li class ="fragment fade-in"> It is important to understand changes in future preferences. </li>
						<ul>
							<li class ="fragment fade-in"> Making summer plans in the winter. </li>
							<li class ="fragment fade-in"> Choosing a major and career. </li>
							<li class ="fragment fade-in"> Having children. </li>
						</ul>
					</ul>
					<p align="left" class ="fragment fade-in">Traditional economic perspective:</p>
					<ul>
						<li class ="fragment fade-in"> People are very good at predicting their future preferences.</li>
					</ul>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>Mis-prediction of Preferences</h2>
					<p align="left">Studies in psychology suggest people exhibit a systematic bias.</p>
					<div class ="fragment fade-in">
						<h3 style="color:#ffcc00;">Projection Bias</h3>
						<blockquote>
						People under-appreciate changes in their preferences, projecting their current preferences onto their future preferences.
						</blockquote>
					</div>
				</section>

				<section>
					<p align="left">Projection bias isn't just mis-prediction.</p>
					<ul>
						<li class ="fragment fade-in"> It is a mis-prediction with a systematic direction.</li>
						<li class ="fragment fade-in"> People don't believe their preferences are transient.</li>
						<li class ="fragment fade-in"> People aren't able to predict all meaningful factors. </li>
					</ul>
					<p align="left" class ="fragment fade-in">We will examine some evidence and discuss its consequences.</p>
				</section>

				<section><h1>Evidence of Projection Bias</h1></section>

				<section>
					<h2>Grocery Shopping</h2>
					<p align="center">
						<img src="/images/teaching/food.png" style="width: 90%;">
					</p>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>Hunger</h2>
					<p align="left">We consider hunger, because:</p>
					<ul>
						<li class ="fragment fade-in"> It's perhaps the clearest evidence of projection bias. </li>
						<li class ="fragment fade-in"> People have lots of experience with being hungry.</li>
					</ul>
					<p align="left" class="fragment fade-in" style="color:#ffcc00;">Meaning: mis-predictions aren't due to a lack of experience.</p>
				</section>

				<section>
					<p align="left">Studies show those shopping on an empty stomach buy more.</p>
					  
					<p align="left" class="fragment fade-in">Consider the following simple experiment:</p>
					<ul>
						<li class ="fragment fade-in"> Randomly give a muffin to individuals entering a supermarket. </li>
						<li class ="fragment fade-in"> Monitor how much food they buy.</li>
					</ul>
				</section>

				<section>
					<p align="left">Gilbert et al. (2002) in <span style="color:#ffcc00;"><em>Org. Behavior and Human Decision Processes</em></span></p>
					  
					<p align="left" class="fragment fade-in">Exit surveys showed:</p>
					<ul>
						<li class ="fragment fade-in"> Those who did not eat muffins:</li>
						<ul>
							<li class ="fragment fade-in"> 51% purchased unplanned food items. </li>
						</ul>
						<li class ="fragment fade-in"> Those who did eat muffins:</li>
						<ul>
							<li class ="fragment fade-in"> 34% purchased unplanned food items. </li>
						</ul>
					</ul>
				</section>

				<section>
					<p align="left">But this study isn't perfect.  It could be:</p>
					<ul>
						<li class ="fragment fade-in"> Shoppers may be buying food for later that day.  </li>
						<li class ="fragment fade-in"> So those who had a muffin buy less.</li>
					</ul>
				</section>

				<section>
					<p align="left">Read and van Leeuwen (1998) in <span style="color:#ffcc00;"><em>Org. Beh. and Human Dec. Proc.</em></span></p>
					<ul>
						<li class ="fragment fade-in"> Office workers were asked: <em>"Would you like a healthy or unhealthy snack in one week?"</em></li>
						<ul>
							<li class ="fragment fade-in"> Sometimes asked when <span style="color:#ffcc00;">hungry</span> (late afternoon) </li>
							<li class ="fragment fade-in"> Sometimes asked when <span style="color:#ffcc00;">satiated</span> (after lunch) </li>
						</ul>
						<li class ="fragment fade-in">They knew snacks would be given either:</li>
						<ul>
							<li class ="fragment fade-in"> When they were <span style="color:#ffcc00;">hungry</span> (late afternoon), or </li>
							<li class ="fragment fade-in"> When <span style="color:#ffcc00;">satiated</span> (immediately after lunch) </li>
						</ul>
					</ul>
				</section>

				<section>
					<p align="left"> Necessary argument:</p>
					<ul>
						<li class ="fragment fade-in"> Those hungry will be tempted by unhealthy food.</li>
						<li class ="fragment fade-in"> Removing hunger allows focus on 'smart' decisions.</li>
