							<li class ="fragment fade-in"> How to invest their funds.</li>

						<li class ="fragment fade-in"> Were not automatically enrolled.</li>
						<li class ="fragment fade-in"> (Could enroll easily at any time.)</li>

					<h2>Getting a Grip on the Default Effect</h2>
					<p align="left"> This appears to be a big mistake by not participating. </p>
					<ul>
						<li class ="fragment fade-in"> Offered a 50% return on up to 6% of your income.</li>
					</ul> 
					<p align="left" class="fragment fade-in"> Example: for an employee making $40,000.</p>
					<ul>
						<li class ="fragment fade-in"> That's giving up a $1,200 gift from the company.</li>
					</ul> 
					<p align="left" class="fragment fade-in"> Even if it is not a mistake, why does the default matter so much?</p>
					<ul>
						<li class ="fragment fade-in"> It only takes a phone call to change enrollment.</li>
					</ul> 
				</section>

				<section>
					<p align="left"> Would people not bother making a phone call for $1,200? </p>
					<ul>
						<li class ="fragment fade-in"> If they are <span style="color:#ffcc00;">naive hyperbolic discounters</span>, they might not.</li>
						<li class ="fragment fade-in"> And as a result, defaults can be extremely important.</li>
					</ul>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>Making the Call:</h2>
					<h2>"I'll do it tomorrow"</h2>
					<p align="left" class="fragment fade-in">Costs and Benefits of Making the Call:</p>
					<ul>
						<li class ="fragment fade-in"> Benefit: will get 5 per day (1,825 per year) extra for the next 30 years starting tomorrow.</li>
						<li class ="fragment fade-in"> Cost: pain of the phone call today costs 30</li>
					</ul> 
					<p align="left" class="fragment fade-in">Assume a <span style="color:#ffcc00;">naive hyperbolic discounter</span> discounts the future at 80%.</p>
				</section>

				<section>
					<p align="left">When to make the call:</p>
					<ul>
						<li class ="fragment fade-in"> Today: $-30+0.8\cdot[5\cdot 365\cdot 30] = 43770$ </li>
						<li class ="fragment fade-in"> Tomorrow: $0+0.8\cdot[-30+5\cdot 365\cdot 30 - 5] = 43772$</li>
					</ul> 
					<p align="left" class="fragment fade-in">Hence, they put off making the phone call. </p>
					<ul>
						<li class ="fragment fade-in"> If nothing changes they put off the phone call forever.</li>
					</ul>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>"I'll do it this week"</h2>
					<h2>(Really, I will)</h2>
					<p align="left" class="fragment fade-in">This prediction is extreme - and it's because the model is extreme. </p>
					<ul>
						<li class ="fragment fade-in"> More reasonable prediction might be they delay for a long time.</li>
					</ul>
				</section>

				<section>
					<p align="left">Let's change the model:</p>
					<ul>
						<li class ="fragment fade-in"> What would a <span style="color:#ffcc00;">sophisticate</span> do? </li>
						<li class ="fragment fade-in"> It's easy to argue they'd do it within a week. </li>
						<ul>
							<li class ="fragment fade-in"> Waiting 8 days costs 40, valued at $0.8\cdot 40=32$</li>
							<li class ="fragment fade-in"> Would rather pay the 30 cost today to avoid this outcome.</li>
						</ul>
					</ul>
					<p align="left" class="fragment fade-in">When <em>exactly</em> they make the call is a more difficult question.
