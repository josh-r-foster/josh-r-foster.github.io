<p>
	The objective of microeconomics is stunning in scope and ambition. Simply put, microeconomics seeks to explain and predict how people choose to behave. In this course, we will explore the basic economic models used by most economists to achieve this objective. In particular, we will explore how these models can be used on people in a variety of roles (e.g., consumers, investors, parents, government officials), as well as how the institutions defining the rules they follow (e.g., capitalistic markets, marriage, legal systems) influence their behavior. The concepts we will discuss can help generate explanations to complex situations, and perhaps even give us an idea of how to improve those situations.
